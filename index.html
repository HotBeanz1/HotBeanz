            <p>
                JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language vital for web interactivity, 
                with cross-platform support, object-oriented capabilities, and efficient 
                handling of asynchronous tasks. Its event-driven architecture and extensive 
                library ecosystem empower developers to create dynamic web experiences, 
                though security, notably against XSS attacks, remains paramount.

            <p>
                HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the backbone of web development, defining the structure and content of web pages. With semantic markup and cross-browser compatibility, HTML facilitates consistent rendering of content across different platforms. Its features include support for accessibility, multimedia integration, and the creation of interactive forms, making it indispensable for building modern, user-friendly websites.

                CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a styling language that enhances the presentation of HTML documents. It enables developers to apply styles like colours, fonts, and spacing, improving the visual appeal and user experience of web pages while promoting consistency across a website.
